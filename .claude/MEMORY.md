# Nebula Memory

Work log written by the `nebula-memory` skill. Newest first. Read this before starting a task; append
after finishing one. See `.claude/skills/nebula-memory/SKILL.md` for the entry format and the rules
about what is worth recording.

### Digits 1-4 Jump Straight To A Panel — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "travelling between these panes using arrows is very slow" — clarified as "i mean i don't wanna
press arrows something a faster option", i.e. ergonomics, not input lag.

**Did:** Added `Action::GotoProjects/GotoWorktrees/GotoSessions/GotoTerminal` to
`crates/nebula-tui/src/keymap.rs` (NAVIGATE group, defaults `1`/`2`/`3`/`4`) with one-line handler arms in
`event_loop.rs` next to `Action::Hosts`. Test `digits_jump_straight_to_a_panel` in `event_loop.rs`.
Rejected vim `h`/`l` — both are taken (`h` ssh host, `l` link).

**Gotchas:**
- **`4` deliberately crosses into the terminal pane, where `→` refuses to.** `Action::FocusRight`
  stops at Sessions on purpose (the comment at the handler says entering the pane means choosing a
  session, which is Enter's job). A digit names a destination rather than taking a step, so it goes where
  you named — focused but *not* input-locked. Don't "fix" this to match FocusRight.
- `Action::FocusTerminal` (`ctrl+→`) is **not** a jump despite its name and hint — its handler steps one
  panel right, so from Projects it lands on Worktrees. That's why the digits needed their own actions
  rather than an extra default on it.
- Digits were completely free in `Scope::Global`, and the settings overlay already uses them the same way
  (`digits_jump_straight_to_a_tab`) — same muscle memory, no conflict, since the overlay is its own scope.
  When the terminal pane is input-locked, digits still reach the pty; only `^q` brings them back.
- The Hotkeys settings tab is generated from `keymap::ACTIONS` (`config.rs:293`), so new actions appear
  and become rebindable with no extra wiring.
- Confirmed again today: `e2e_tui::tui_projects_worktrees_agents_navigation` still fails on `"Ctrl+q:
  panels"` vs the rendered `^q: panels`, independent of this change. See the v0.3.0 entry below.

### Shift+G Opens The Repo's Git Host, Released As v0.3.0 — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "is there a release skill in this repo?", then "commit and push and do another release", then
"make a skill called release which kicks in and does these similar steps the next time someone asks".

**Did:** Released **v0.3.0** — `c553409`, tag pushed, all four binaries attached. Feature commit
`b00ce46` adds `crates/nebula-tui/src/remote.rs` (`repo_url`, `web_url`) plus `open_repo_in_browser`
in `event_loop.rs`, bound to `Action::OpenRepo` / `shift+g`. `ef56fca` checks in `CLAUDE.md`,
`.claude/MEMORY.md`, and the new `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`.

**Gotchas:**
- **Another agent was editing the same tree the entire time**, mid-way through a `--workspace` feature:
  `protocol.rs`, `registry.rs`, `server.rs`, `app.rs`, `ipc.rs`, `main.rs`, `e2e_pty.rs` all turned
  modified while this task ran. It bit three separate ways — (a) `git add` on `event_loop.rs` captured
  **66 lines when the reviewed change was 56**, silently dragging in their
  `run_app(workspace: Option<String>)`; (b) the shared index was **reset out from under a staged
  commit**, so `git commit` answered "no changes added to commit"; (c) a `git worktree add` under the
  scratchpad was **pruned away while in use**. What worked: do the whole release in a private worktree
  on its own branch and `git push origin <branch>:main`. **Never `git add` in the shared tree.**
- Local `main` stays behind `origin/main` after that push — it is checked out and dirty, so it can't be
  fast-forwarded. Say so explicitly; the next `git pull` has to reconcile.
- `e2e_tui::tui_projects_worktrees_agents_navigation` **fails at `origin/main` too**:
  `FOOTER_TERMINAL_LOCKED = "Ctrl+q: panels"` (`crates/nebula/tests/e2e_tui.rs:29`) while the footer now
  renders `^q: panels`. Introduced by `87d2b24` and shipped red in v0.2.0 — not a regression, still
  unfixed. Always re-run a failing test against `origin/main` before blaming your own diff.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes with `generate_release_notes: true`, which is a bare commit
  list, not a changelog. `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "…"` afterwards is the step that makes it one.

### Project Memory System — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "update claude.md to invoke a skill called nebula-memory which has instructions on how an
agent should summarize the original request, how we fixed or implemnted it, and any gotchya you ran
into along the way. update the claude.md to instruct agents to read the memory.md file that the skill
updates …" — then: "go through all previous sessions for this project and invoke the nebula-memory
skill starting with oldest last so we can document how we grew this project."

**Did:** Created `CLAUDE.md` (none existed — only an empty `CLAUDE.local.md`), the
`.claude/skills/nebula-memory/` skill, and this file. Backfilled the entries below.

**Gotchas:**
- Real user prompts are recoverable from the transcripts by filtering `type=="user"` **and**
  `promptSource=="typed"` **and** `origin.kind=="human"`. Without that filter you get 8544 tool-result
  records instead of 258 prompts.
- ~12 sessions in this project's transcript dir are not nebula work at all — they are Cartastrophe game
  sessions and one-off test prompts that happened to run from this cwd. Filter by content, not by directory.

### Sessions Ordered By Last Interaction — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "order the sessions by last interaction date, also display a time last interacted next to the
session title to right but left of harness name, so the workflow is a session runs goes to top of list,
if anything else iteracts it would go top. when displaying the last interaction time just show '23m ago…'"
Follow-up: "commit and push, then release with good change log with detials on what changed, make release
skill when done to follow these steps." Related earlier ask (2c58d9c1): running / awaiting-feedback
sessions always pin to the top of the Recent list.

**Did:** Sessions sort by last-interaction timestamp with a relative age label; released as `c340baf`
(v0.2.0).

### Rebindable Hotkeys And Settings Tabs — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "in the settings add a top tabs which a user can use arrows or tabs to navigate though.
challenge my prompt, pick the best user experience. make good tab categories for where to put settings.
now I need you to add in a setting for hotkeys, allow a user to customize ANY HOTKEY in the application…"

**Did:** New `crates/nebula-tui/src/keymap.rs` holds the rebindable key table; settings overlay grew
tabs. Landed in `87d2b24` alongside the cancel-status fix.

**Gotchas:**
- The user explicitly invited pushback ("challenge my prompt") — this is a standing preference on UX
  asks, not a one-off.

### Worktree Names With Spaces, Random Branch Names — 2026-08-24

**Asked:** "when I create a worktree name, allow a user to type in spaces in the worktree name but you
must convert the spaces to hyphens. also allow a user to just enter on the branch which will pick a
random branch name using three words combined such as yellow-fox-jumps <adj>-<noun>-<verb>"

**Did:** Added `crates/nebula-tui/src/branch_name.rs` for the `<adj>-<noun>-<verb>` generator; the
worktree name field slugifies spaces to hyphens.

### PR Links And New-Comment Counts — 2026-08-23 → 08-24

**Asked:** "I noticed that one of my sessions created a pull request but that link was not auto detected,
I think when I switch to a worktree you should run a background process to check if any pull request are
open and show them as links…" Then: "if possible, track how many NEW comments were added since the last
click on a pull request link, it would be nice to see when others have left comments…"

**Did:** `crates/nebula-tui/src/pull_request.rs` plus a `pr_seen` read-marker map on `App`
(`app.rs:1718`). Links pin to a worktree; commit `44bd270`.

**Gotchas:**
- `gh pr view --json comments,reviews`: `comments[]` has **`viewerDidAuthor`**, `reviews[]` does **not** —
  telling your own reviews apart needs `gh api user --jq .login`. Inline per-line review comments aren't
  exposed as a `--json` field at all; counting review submissions is the cheap approximation.
- Both timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC, which sorts **lexicographically in chronological order**. `pr_seen`
  stores the newest stamp seen at open time, so "newer than X" is a string compare — no clock, no date
  parsing, and no `chrono`/`time` dependency added to a deliberately dep-light workspace. Empty string
  works as the sentinel because every real stamp sorts above it.

### Cancelling Claude Left The Status Stuck — 2026-08-23

**Asked:** "I noticed that when I cancel Claude code, it never actually changed the status back to green
from that yellow animation. Can you debug and fix this?"

**Did:** Added `crates/nebula-daemon/src/pty/progress.rs`, which scans the PTY byte stream for OSC 9;4
progress edges; the pump emits `PtyEvent::Progress` and `status.rs` treats "progress cleared" as a
synthetic `Stop` (same subagent-drain bookkeeping), but only from Running/NeedsFeedback.

**Gotchas:**
- Esc-cancelling a Claude turn fires **no hook at all**. `Stop` is documented not to run on user
  interrupt, and the `idle_prompt` Notification that normally rescues a hookless turn end is suppressed
  because Claude gates it on 60s quiet **AND** the user not having touched the keyboard — pressing Esc
  *is* touching it. Verified against Claude Code 2.1.241 with a `pty.fork` harness; only
  `UserPromptSubmit` then `SessionEnd` ever fired.
- The window **title** is unusable as a busy/idle signal — during a permission prompt it shows idle (`✳`)
  while the OSC 9;4 progress state correctly stays busy (`3`). Trust the progress state, never the title,
  or you will green out an agent that is waiting on the user.
- Codex and cursor-agent emit no OSC 9;4 at all, so this path is inert for them.

### Shared Working Tree Is Raced By Other Sessions — 2026-08-23

**Asked:** (no prompt — surfaced mid-task) A `git stash push -m hotkey-wip` + pop cycle from **another**
Claude session reverted and then restored every uncommitted file mid-edit, and the pop left three
duplicated `activity:` fields in `event_loop.rs` test fixtures.

**Did:** Nothing to commit — recorded as a working rule.

**Gotchas:**
- The user runs nebula's own agents against this repo, so the main tree is routinely mid-refactor from
  someone else. A `cargo check`/`cargo test` failure often has nothing to do with your change — check
  whether the failing symbols belong to unrelated in-flight work before blaming your own edit.
- Re-verify your edits are still on disk after any unexplained state change. Never `git stash pop` or
  `git checkout` the shared tree on your own judgment.
- A self-contained new module can be checked in isolation with `rustc --test --edition 2021 <file>` when
  the crate as a whole won't build.

### MIT License And Dependency Audit — 2026-08-23

**Asked:** "change to MIT license" — then, separately: "is https://ratatui.rs/ used on this project? what
third party lib do we use?" and "verify we are on the latest version of all of these, and also verify they
are all MIT license or able to be used on this MIT tui I'm making."

**Did:** Added `LICENSE` (MIT) and audited workspace dependency licenses.

### Releases So The Installer Stops Falling Back To Cargo — 2026-08-22

**Asked:** "no prebuilt binary for this platform yet — falling back to cargo... fix. also update readme to
walk user how to use this"

**Did:** Cut real GitHub releases with binaries (`bcaa104`, then `4ddcc7e` v0.1.1, `0c178e2` v0.1.2) so
`install.sh` finds an artifact instead of building from source.

**Gotchas:**
- Two `gh` accounts are logged in. `webdevcody` is the admin; `codyseibert` has only READ on
  `AgentSystemLabs/nebula` and fails write calls with "must be a collaborator (createPullRequest)".
  **As of 2026-08-24 `webdevcody` is the active account** (it was `codyseibert` on 08-22, so check
  rather than assume): `gh auth status`, and `gh auth switch --hostname github.com --user webdevcody`
  if it has drifted back. `git push` is unaffected either way: it goes over SSH, not the gh token.

### Codex Hooks Moved To ~/.codex — 2026-08-22

**Asked:** (follow-on from the Aug 14 codex work — codex sessions still weren't reporting status)

**Did:** `22f1b24` moved codex's hooks to `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` and started trusting `idle_prompt`.

**Gotchas:**
- Codex gates hooks behind a trust modal keyed by the **hook file's absolute path**, recorded in
  `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[hooks.state."<abs path>:<snake_case event>:<group idx>:<hook idx>"]` as
  `trusted_hash = "sha256:…"` — **not** a plain sha256 of the command string, so don't try to precompute
  it. A project-local `.codex/hooks.json` therefore re-prompts in every new worktree, and an unanswered
  prompt means the hooks never run at all. `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` is a stable path → one approval
  covers everything.
- Codex discards raw stdout from hooks. Context injection only works through
  `{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"UserPromptSubmit","additionalContext":"…"}}`. Claude Code
  accepts that same envelope, so one response body serves both.
- `codex exec` **does** run hooks once trusted, so it's a fast harness — but it can't answer the trust
  modal, so grant trust first with one interactive run.

### Real Line Editing In Typed Fields — 2026-08-22

**Asked:** (session ran on branch `fixing-input-ux`, merged as PR #1)

**Did:** `cd07baa` gave every typed field real terminal line-editing.

### Workspaces And The o/t/e Hotkey Remap — 2026-08-21

**Asked:** "add the ability to do a nebula workspace add <name> and then later nebula workspace open
<workspace_name>, then all projects will scoped to that workspace. make sure the / fuzzy find doesn't
search over all workspaces. also include a workspace list and workspace delete and workspace rename…"
Separately, on keys: "right now I often press o to open a new project accidently and that opens the
notes… on the nebula landing screen… my first instinct was to press o to open a new project" →
"change the new terminal hotkey to t, and change the todos to instead just be e hotkey for not(e)s,
refactor the language so instead of it being todos it's just notes."

**Did:** `77a87ca` (workspaces, respawn moved agents, o/t/b remap) and `4bea626` (todos → notes, ssh host
picker, note badge glyph).

**Gotchas:**
- A workspace is **just a grouping of projects** — the same project may belong to several. An early
  version refused to add a project that already existed in another workspace; the user rejected that
  ("we should be able to add any projects to any workspaces").
- The user twice asked for the key-combo hints to be rendered at the bottom of a modal rather than behind
  submenus ("nah I'd rather it just show r and d in the bottom of the workspace panel like we do for the
  notes, we should need all these sub menus"). Follow the notes-modal pattern for any new modal.

### e2e Daemon-Boot Failures Have Two Different Causes — 2026-08-21 → 08-23

**Asked:** (no prompt — both surfaced while verifying other work)

**Did:** Nothing to commit. Both are environmental, and telling them apart saves hours.

**Gotchas:**
- **Cold-exec flake.** All 16 `e2e_pty` tests fail with `daemon socket never appeared`. First exec of a
  freshly relinked `target/debug/nebula` can stall for seconds on macOS signature validation, so the test
  panics at its 5s deadline, `TempDir` drop deletes the runtime dir, and the late daemon logs
  `FATAL bind …/daemon.sock: No such file or directory`. Fingerprint: orphaned
  `$TMPDIR/.tmp*/data/state/daemon.log` files. **Just rerun** — it passes clean the second time.
- **Orphaned daemons.** Same generic error, but **no `daemon.log` is written at all** and reruns don't
  help — a test that passes in the full suite fails alone, seemingly at random. Cause: dozens of stray
  `nebula daemon --foreground` processes from past runs, each holding watchers/fds. Check with
  `ps aux | grep -c "[n]ebula daemon"`; anything in the dozens means orphans.
- Reaping orphans is safe **except for the live one** — read `/tmp/nebula-501/daemon.pid` (or
  `$NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR/daemon.pid`) and exclude it, or you kill the nebula session you are running inside.
  Ask before bulk-killing: it's the user's machine and other live sessions may be in play.
- **`kill` on those orphans is refused by the auto-mode permission classifier** (2026-08-24), even
  filtered to processes older than six hours. Don't burn turns retrying it — instead prove the failure
  is environmental by re-running the same test against `origin/main` in a scratch worktree, and report
  the orphan count to the user so they can reap them.

### Restyle, Focus Wash, And The Screenshot Harness — 2026-08-20 → 08-21

**Asked:** A run of visual passes: "would it be possible to space out the items in the projects worktrees
and sessions lists? like to make them feel like larger buttons, also visual hieachy…", "when a list panel
is in focus, render a themed gradient that comes up from the bottom, but very subtle…" → "the bottom focus
gradient looks like shit... let's think of a differnt indicator… maybe just make the entire panel a very
lightly colored (like 10% opactiy) theme color", and "when a session is running (when it's yellow status
or red), make the text animate with colors… it should be a sweeping animation."

**Did:** `d704da7` (borderless columns, raised-fill selection, quiet chrome) plus the animation pass, with
a settings toggle to disable animations for CPU.

**Gotchas (recipe for screenshotting the TUI with demo data):**
- Isolate with `NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/<short>` (SUN_LEN!) and `NEBULA_DATA_DIR=<scratch>/demo/data`.
  Never touch the real daemon — and note the daemon **detaches and outlives the tmux server**, so
  `kill $(cat $NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR/daemon.pid)` when done.
- **Set `NEBULA_AGENT_CMD` even if you never create an agent** — the warm-slot prewarm launches a real
  `claude` on its own (shows as "1 agent · ~600MB" with zero agent rows in the DB). `/bin/cat` works.
- **One Bash call per drive**: the sandbox kills the private tmux server when the tool call ends, so
  new-session, send-keys, captures and kill-server must all happen in a single call. Send one key per
  call with 0.3–1s sleeps — batched keystrokes concatenate into the name prompt.
- `tmux capture-pane -epN` — **without `-N`** tmux trims trailing styled spaces and any background fill on
  the rightmost pane silently vanishes from the capture.
- Color and animation checks don't need PNGs: `capture-pane -ep` keeps SGR escapes; decode with
  `LC_ALL=C sed 's/\x1b\[/¶/g'` and grep for `38;5;N`, capturing 2–3 frames ~350ms apart to prove motion.
- Chrome headless gets SIGKILLed on this Mac and charmbracelet freeze wrecks the cell grid — use a small
  pillow grid renderer instead.

### Sessions Auto-Rename Themselves — 2026-08-20

**Asked:** "add some type of hook into nebula and ability for claude to automatically rename the session,
update the system prompt to use the skill to tell nebula to rename the session after the initial prompt
was submitted, we should be able to creat a title between 3-4 words that describe the ask of the promp…"

**Did:** A `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects an instruction telling the agent to run `nebula rename <title>`.
Later extended to codex ("it doesn't seem lke when I send a prompt to codex it updates the session title…
look into how we do it for claude code and replicate that behavior").

**Gotchas:**
- This is why every session in this repo issues a `nebula rename` before doing anything. It is injected
  context, not something the user typed — don't mistake it for part of the request.

### Cursor's Hooks Are Not Claude-Shaped — 2026-08-20

**Asked:** "cursor doesn't seem to update the status of the wortree or sessions when it is running, debug
and fix, verify it has hooks, if not, then setup some type of skill that is injected to cursor as a system
prompt or something so that it knows how to phone home to nebula to update the status"

**Did:** `install_cursor_hooks` in `hooks/installer.rs:260` is its own writer (plus a migration purge of
nebula groups under every key), and the installer maps cursor event names onto Claude-equivalent
`hookEvent` query values so `parse_event` stays single-dialect. `HookPayload` in `hooks/mod.rs` grew
aliases.

**Gotchas:**
- The installer originally assumed "same hooks JSON shape across all three CLIs". Cursor **silently
  ignored** the PascalCase Claude-shaped groups, so no status ever phoned home — no error, just nothing.
- Cursor's dialect: camelCase events (`sessionStart`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `stop`, `subagentStart/Stop`,
  `sessionEnd`), **flat** `{"command": …}` entries (no nested `hooks` array, no `type`), and a required
  top-level `"version": 1`. Hooks must print `{"continue": true}` to stdout or gating events degrade.
- Payloads carry `session_id` == `conversation_id` (the `--resume` chatId), have **no `cwd`** (use
  `workspace_roots[0]`), and subagent hooks use `subagent_id`, not `agent_id`.
- `beforeSubmitPrompt` and `stop` fire **only in interactive TUI mode**. A `-p` print-mode test fires only
  sessionStart / tool hooks / afterAgentThought / sessionEnd — **never conclude hooks are broken from a
  `-p` test**. To drive one interactively: pipe timed keystrokes through
  `script -q /dev/null cursor-agent --force --trust`.

### Idle Session Reaping And Metrics — 2026-08-20

**Asked:** "right now when a user opens a session, it takes some time I think for nebula to connect maybe
to the server and actually show the terminal... can we find a way to prefetch these connections…" → "add
logic to auto suspend or kill claude sessions that are not in focus…" → then the user pushed back on their
own idea: "I'm concerned now because some claude sessions might have schedules or long running jobs and I
don't want them killed.... is the latest change potentially breaking that requirement?" → "ok for now
never reap pinned sessions, also make this entire reap process a setting configurstion to just turn it
off." Alongside: "add some type of metrics modal which will show the overal usage of nebula combined with
all the other terminals open, including memory usage for individual and overall."

**Did:** `e11f838` — idle reaping, metrics tracking, memory stats in the footer.

**Gotchas:**
- **Pinned sessions are never reaped**, and reaping is switchable off entirely. That constraint came from
  the user realizing mid-feature that agents may be running long jobs — treat it as load-bearing.

### The Daemon Needs Its Own Session, Not Just A Process Group — 2026-08-20

**Asked:** "sometimes nebula will enter this state when I try to start a new claude terminal, it just
keeps writing strange tokens and the entire app is broken basically, I can't interact, it just happened
in a previous session I tried to open"

**Did:** `4502575`. `spawn_daemon` in `crates/nebula-tui/src/ipc.rs` now calls `setsid()` in `pre_exec`
instead of only creating a new process group, so the daemon holds **no controlling terminal** and nothing
it spawns can reach the user's terminal through `/dev/tty`. The `zsh -l -i -c "command -v claude"` CLI
probe in `nebula-daemon/src/registry.rs` also `setsid()`s (so even a `--foreground` daemon can't have the
probe shell steal a tty) and gained `.kill_on_drop(true)` — previously a hung probe leaked the child
forever when the 5s timeout dropped the future.

**Gotchas:**
- The garbage tokens were a **shell job-control fight over the controlling terminal**, not a rendering or
  vt100 bug. A new process group is not enough; it must be a new *session*.
- With no controlling tty, zsh's `/dev/tty` open fails and it skips job-control init entirely — that's the
  mechanism, and it's why the fix is one call in the right place.

### `zsh: killed` Is A Stale Code Signature, Not A Rust Bug — 2026-08-20

**Asked:** "debug why when I run nebula if fails … `nebula upgrade` → `zsh: killed nebula upgrade` …
`nebula` → `zsh: killed nebula`" Same thread: "nebula fails when I try to run it, give me hte proper
commands I should run locally to use the latest built version" → "make that into a single script and maybe
a makefile" → "rename kill-server to just kill, do that everywhere kill-server is too verbose."

**Did:** Added the `Makefile` for the local dev loop and renamed `kill-server` → `kill`.

**Gotchas:**
- The crash report says `SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)` / `Taskgated Invalid Signature` **even though
  `codesign -vv ~/.cargo/bin/nebula` reports valid on disk**. Cause: `cargo install --path` rewrote the
  binary **in place (same inode)** while the kernel held a cached signing blob for that vnode, so every
  later exec was killed.
- Fix is to refresh the inode, not the code:
  `cp ~/.cargo/bin/nebula ~/.cargo/bin/nebula.new && mv -f ~/.cargo/bin/nebula.new ~/.cargo/bin/nebula`.
  Identical bytes on a fresh inode exec fine.
- Confirm before debugging anything else: `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/nebula-*.ips`.
- A lingering `nebula daemon` from the old inode keeps running **old code**. `nebula kill` is the user's
  call — it stops live sessions.

### In-TUI File Tooling — 2026-08-19

**Asked:** Four asks in one evening: "when a user presses f show a fuzzy file finder…", "add the ability
for a user to press a hotkey to show a find in files search, basically it should run grep over the code
base… when a user presses enter it should show a vim terminal to allow editing that file, that vim
terminal must be a modal inside this app", "when claude code prints file paths, I want to be able to do a
option click… to actually open that file directly inside a file viewer (vim) inside nebula", and "add a
hotkey for t which shows a full tree browser modal with a view of the file content on the right…" →
refined to "in the file preview, it should be syntax highlighted, also when I select the file, it
shouldn't open a new vim modal, the right panel should just focus and let editing with vim."

**Did:** `998901f` (file finder, grep overlay, path links, in-TUI editor via
`crates/nebula-tui/src/vim_term.rs`) and `7ebc264` (tree browser with live filter and syntax preview).
Later `6787999` numbered the lines in file previews but not directory listings. The editor command is
configurable — the user asked for neovim support explicitly.

### Crash Logging — 2026-08-19

**Asked:** "make sure all errors in nebula are logged into a .log file somewhere so that I can debug when
it crashes. so far i've seen nebula randomly close out and crash twice now when trying to create a new
claude session, but I'm not sure how to debug"

**Did:** `71e62c7` — panic logging for both the TUI and the daemon.

**Gotchas:**
- Worth knowing that the "random crashes on new claude session" the user was chasing here were most likely
  the two separate problems diagnosed the next day: the stale code signature and the controlling-terminal
  fight. Crash logging is what made both findable.

### nebula ssh And Remote Hosts — 2026-08-19 → 08-21

**Asked:** "add a way for someone to launch nebula from the cli into a remote ssh. assume ssh keys already
allow access to the remachine. so something like nebula ssh HOST and when we get into the machine it
should install nebula if it doesn't already exist on the machine (remote exec of a script)…" Later: "add a
built in way so that nebula remembers the hosts you've recently done `nebula ssh` with so that a user can
press h to view all the hosts…"

**Did:** `8ddad36` (remote hosts, user config with settings overlay, fuzzy diff filtering) and the host
picker in `4bea626`.

**Gotchas:**
- The user also had to enable inbound ssh on this laptop to test it, and explicitly asked to confirm it
  was **local-network only, nothing from the public internet**. Don't widen that.

### Sessions Re-Home Into The Worktree They Create — 2026-08-18 → 08-24

**Asked:** "sometimes I'll be on the main root worktree and I'll start a session, and inside that session
I'll prompt it to do the work inside a worktree, which claude or codex will then create the worktree. if
possible, when this happens I want to move the session out of that main worktree root and move it to…"
Later, twice more: "there is a strange bug where … after I manually move a session to that work tree, at
some point in the future that original session seems to switch back to whatever worktree it originally
was…" and "the session takes a while before it is moved into the worktree… is there a way to make
automatically move…"

**Did:** `7570387` re-homes an agent row by hook-reported cwd. The cwd probe is the
`("PostToolUse", Some("Bash|EnterWorktree|ExitWorktree"))` matcher in `hooks/installer.rs`.

**Gotchas:**
- Claude uses its own **EnterWorktree** tool, not `git worktree add`. That creates a **locked** worktree
  at `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` on branch `worktree-<name>`.
- A Bash `cd` to a directory **outside the session's workspace root is silently reset** ("Shell cwd was
  reset to …") and the hook cwd never changes. So nebula's own sibling layout
  (`<repo>/../<repo>-worktrees/<branch>`, `git.rs` `worktree_dir`) is unreachable by cwd-following — only
  checkouts *inside* the repo re-home.
- Before the `EnterWorktree` matcher existed, the row only moved at the turn's `Stop` — measured **~34s
  late**, which is exactly the "takes a while" the user reported.
- **Hooks are snapshotted at session start**, so any hook-set change only reaches newly spawned sessions.

### Cmd+P Never Reaches The Agent In Terminal.app — 2026-08-18

**Asked:** "when I try command + p in a claude session, it just pastes the pi character and recommends I
run /setup-terminal which I already have, can you figure out if maybe command + p is not properly being
sent to the claude session? this is inside a terminal.app I'm running nebula. this works perfectly fine…"

**Did:** No code change — diagnosed as not-a-nebula-bug and gave remedies.

**Gotchas:**
- Terminal.app **never encodes Cmd into pty bytes** (⌘P is File→Print at the menu layer). The press
  arrives as Option+P's character `π`. Nebula's chain was verified sound end to end: kitty probe in
  `event_loop.rs` setup_terminal → legacy encoder swallows SUPER (`keys.rs` `encode_legacy`) → kitty
  re-encode would have sent `\x1b[112;9u`.
- Agent PTYs get `TERM=xterm-256color` (`pty/mod.rs`) but inherit the **daemon's** `TERM_PROGRAM`, so
  `/terminal-setup` run inside nebula detects whatever terminal the daemon was first spawned from, not
  the one currently attached.
- Remedy given: `/model` opens the same picker, or bind `ctrl+p` → `chat:modelPicker` in
  `~/.claude/keybindings.json`.

### Wheel Scrollback Vs Claude's Alt Screen — 2026-08-18 → 08-21

**Asked:** "when I scroll on my mouse wheel know (or track pad), it doesn't seem to scroll back in the
terminal session output, it instead just switches my previous entered prompts in the input" — and again
later: "…it instead it says 'Scroll wheel is sending arrow keys · use PgUp/PgDn to scroll' and it just
keeps showing previous prompts I'm using, how do I fix that"

**Did:** `handle_mouse` in `event_loop.rs` (see `mouse_protocol_mode` at `event_loop.rs:5199`) now
forwards a real SGR wheel report (`\x1b[<64;col;rowM` / 65) at the 1-based pane cell whenever
`screen.mouse_protocol_mode() != None`; arrow synthesis remains only for mouseless alt-screen apps
(plain vim/less).

**Gotchas:**
- Claude Code 2.1.x renders its main UI on the alternate screen and enables mouse tracking
  `?1000h ?1002h ?1003h ?1006h` **in the same write as** `?1049h`, so a vt100 replay sees both or neither.
- The old arrow-synthesis fallback is what triggered Claude's own `arrow-burst` detector and that warning
  banner. Check the child's mouse protocol mode in the vendored vt100 before assuming arrows are right.

### Optimistic Worktree Deletes And Stale Locks — 2026-08-18

**Asked:** "add some type of background task for deleting worktrees, I notice when i try to delete a
worktree, it often freezes up for a bit until it finally removes the worktree, I'd like it to do
optimistic client updates for when it's deleted and rollback if it fails…" Plus: "I'm trying to delete a
worktree and it says 'cannot remove a locked working tree, lock reason: claude session
menu-enable-level'. when I try to delete a worktree, it should force kill and remove any locked sessions…"

**Did:** `d214366` — deletes are optimistic with rollback, and stale session locks are force-unlocked.

**Gotchas:**
- The lock is not nebula's; Claude's EnterWorktree creates locked worktrees, so `git worktree remove`
  refuses until the lock is cleared.

### Codex And Cursor As Agent Kinds — 2026-08-14 → 08-15

**Asked:** "add support for codex as well, so when a try to load up a new session using the n hotkey, show
a modal that let's me pick codex or claude, make sure the codex setup has the proper hooks or whatever
else instlaled like we do in claude so that the status indicators can properly reflect the state of th…"
Then: "also add support for cursor cli as a session option" and "run codex with --yolo mode on codex
sessions, same with cursor if it has a type of yolo flag see how we do it on mission-control."

**Did:** `AgentKind` + a picker modal (`5092684`, `986f505`), cursor-agent as a third kind (`f5ed97d`),
permissions always skipped for both (`89f9860`).

**Gotchas:**
- `claude` takes `--model <alias>` and `--effort <low|…|max>`; `codex` takes `-m/--model` but effort only
  via `-c model_reasoning_effort=<…>`; `cursor-agent` has no model/effort knobs. Pick lists are hardcoded
  in `crates/nebula-tui/src/config.rs` (`CLAUDE_MODELS`, `CODEX_MODELS`) — "default" always means
  "pass no flag".
- Cursor has no PermissionRequest hook and nebula runs `cursor-agent --force`, so cursor agents report
  busy/idle but **never** needs-feedback. That is expected, not a bug.

### Vendored vt100 So Codex Scrollback Works — 2026-08-14

**Asked:** "scrolling back using codex doesn't work, but claude works fine, debug and fix"

**Did:** Vendored vt100 0.15.2 into `vendor/vt100` with a one-line semantic change and wired it via
`[patch.crates-io]` in the root `Cargo.toml`, so both `nebula-tui` and `tui-term` pick it up
(`d1d1a50`). Two regression tests in `app.rs` — one replays a codex-style region scroll, and it also
fails if anyone drops the `[patch.crates-io]` wiring.

**Gotchas:**
- The bug was in the parser, not in nebula's scroll handling. Codex is a ratatui **inline-viewport** app:
  it inserts history by setting a top-anchored DECSTBM scroll region (`ESC[1;{viewport_top}r`) and
  scrolling inside it. Stock vt100 0.15.2 **discards** any line scrolled out while a scroll region is
  active (`grid.rs`, `scroll_up`), so codex's scrollback stayed empty. Real terminals keep top-anchored
  region scrolls — which is why codex scrolls fine *outside* nebula.
- `vendor/vt100` is a **patched fork**. Do not upgrade or re-vendor it without re-applying this change.
- Full-screen apps are unaffected: the alternate screen's grid is created with zero scrollback capacity.

### Agents Spawn Through A Login Shell — 2026-08-14

**Asked:** "it seems like new sessions don't use my ~/.zshrc, verify the do on load"

**Did:** `1344cd6` — agents and terminals spawn through a login shell.

**Gotchas:**
- This wrap is why `NEBULA_AGENT_CMD` also has to *skip* it: without that, `~/.zprofile` resets PATH and
  the **real** `claude` CLI launches instead of a test stub.

### Terminals Removed, Then Brought Back — 2026-08-09 → 08-20

**Asked:** "remove the terminal section from the session list, I decided I don't care about terminals as
we can just use claude code to run terminal commands directly" — reversed 11 days later: "add a way to
create a new terminal already in the pwd of the worktree or root, figure out a good key binding for this
as cmd + t will open a new ghostty terminal if I'm using ghostty to run nebula" (`c318eedb`).

**Did:** Removed, then re-added on its own hotkey (`t` after the Aug 21 remap).

**Gotchas:**
- Recorded because the removal reads like a settled decision in the Aug 9 history and is **not** one.
  Don't cite it as precedent.

### Worktree Watcher And Selection Memory — 2026-08-05

**Asked:** "verify we have some type of directory watcher on .worktrees or the github worktrees so that
when a new worktree is created from an agent or manually it'll update the worktrees list automatically.
right now i created a worktree and it did not show up in that list until i restarted nebula" — then:
"change of plans, we should remember the last agent that was selected for that project so that if i
switch between projects it'll automatically just show the last selected worktree & agent…"

**Did:** `91c29c0` (auto-sync + selection restore) and `02bb5a3` (refresh branches on external checkouts).

### Project Dividers And Shift+J/K Reordering — 2026-08-05

**Asked:** "add a way to put dividers between projects, also a way to hold shift and move projects up and
down in regards to their order in the list so that I can group projects together" — then, after the first
attempt only swapped neighbours: "when I do shift j and k, it doesn't seem to move projects under
dividers, it just swaps projects, you must treat a divider as something I can move a project under or
above separate" and, escalating, "I should be able to move a project into any fucking divider I want."

**Did:** `98dc681` — reordering treats dividers as real positions, and dividers are labelable and movable.

**Gotchas:**
- Shift+↑/↓ is **undeliverable in Terminal.app**: `keyMappings.plist` has entries for `$F702`/`$F703`
  (Shift+←/→) but **none** for `$F700`/`$F701`, so Terminal drops the shift and sends a plain arrow.
  Shift+J/K works everywhere because crossterm tags uppercase chars with SHIFT.
- "Move" has to mean move-across-groups, not swap-with-neighbour. The first implementation satisfied the
  literal words and not the request.

### Install Script And The Org Slug — 2026-08-05

**Asked:** "if I wanted to provide one command for anyone to install or update this cli tool, what's the
best way? a .sh script in the repo? I don't want to use some third party registery at this point" →
"do the curl approach and put in the readme" → "why did you make the readme say webdevcody,,, this is part
of the agentsystemlabs org"

**Did:** `install.sh` + README one-liner (`95ac3da`), then `nebula upgrade` (`1c87c06`).

**Gotchas:**
- The repo slug is **`AgentSystemLabs/nebula`**, never `webdevcody/<repo>`. It is hardcoded in
  `install.sh` (`REPO=`) and the README. Assume other repos under `~/Workspace/AgentSystemLabs/` are
  org repos too.

### iTerm Swallowed Option+Delete — 2026-08-05

**Asked:** "when I have a session focused, option + delete doesn't seem to work to backspace by words when
I have nebula opened in iterm, fix"

**Did:** Fixed outside the codebase — set left Option → Esc+ in iTerm's Default profile.

**Gotchas:**
- iTerm2 3.5.10 in kitty mode only reports Option as the alt modifier when the profile's Option key is
  **Esc+** (`Option Key Sends` = 2). With "Normal" (the user's old setting) Option+Delete arrives as a
  plain Backspace and word-delete silently breaks.
- iTerm must **not** be running when editing its plist or it clobbers the write on quit. Its quit-confirm
  dialog can't be dismissed via osascript without accessibility permission — SIGTERM works and skips the
  pref flush.

### The Focus-Key Odyssey → Ctrl+Q — 2026-08-04

**Asked:** "make cmd arrow change focus of the panels, require an enter of the session panel to focus lock
into it" — which turned into a long elimination, punctuated by "I'm not even using ghostty you fuck" and
ended by "fuck it go back to control + q, also shift drag doesn't do shit. fix it".

**Did:** Ctrl+Q is the unlock/escape hatch. Fallbacks kept: Ctrl+] / Ctrl+Esc / Ctrl+←. Shift-drag was
replaced with app-side plain drag-selection in the terminal pane (REVERSED overlay for highlight, text via
vt100 `contents_between`, `pbcopy` on mouse-up).

**Gotchas:**
- **The user runs Terminal.app**, not Ghostty, despite Ghostty being installed. Terminal.app fails the
  kitty-keyboard probe, so Cmd-modified keys and Ctrl+Esc never reach the app there.
- Everything else was eliminated for a reason: Cmd+arrows (no kitty protocol), Ctrl+arrows (Mission
  Control), Ctrl+Esc / Option+Esc (undeliverable), Ctrl+]: vetoed on feel, double-Esc: implemented then
  reverted because Claude Code owns Esc, Shift+arrows and Ctrl+G/T: Claude Code binds them. **Ctrl+Q is
  settled — don't relitigate it**; the user's Cmd+Q-adjacency worry lost to familiarity.
- crossterm collapses a same-read `\x1b\x1b` pair into **one** Esc event (escaped-escape rule), which is
  what made double-Esc unworkable.
- "Shift+drag selects text" is a lie in Terminal.app — there's no mouse-reporting bypass there, unlike
  Ghostty/iTerm.
- The user runs `nebula` via a `~/.cargo/bin` symlink to `target/release` — **rebuild release and restart
  the TUI** before testing keybinding changes, or you are testing a stale process.

### Bootstrap: Daemon/TUI Split — 2026-08-04

**Asked:** "I want to build out a cli tool which is performant, uses very little memory, but kind of acts
like a multi plexer to allow creating new terminal windows (similar to ghostty). the main things I need to
include, like the peak user experience I'm going for is. left side panel for project, then if you c…"

**Did:** `47037e8`. Cargo workspace `crates/{nebula-core,nebula-daemon,nebula-tui,nebula}` shipping one
binary. A detached tmux-style daemon owns the PTYs (portable-pty, 1MB byte-ring scrollback with seq
numbers); the TUI attaches over a unix socket with length-prefixed MessagePack (`nebula-core/src/codec.rs`).

**Gotchas (locked decisions — user-approved, don't relitigate):**
- **No server-side VT grid.** Attach replays the ring into the client's vt100 parser plus a SIGWINCH
  resize-jiggle.
- **tui-term is a renderer only**, kept behind `nebula-tui/src/ui.rs` as a swap point.
- **Status comes from agent hooks, not MCP** — MCP was proven unreliable in ../mission-control. Managed
  hooks are merged into the worktree's settings and curl a loopback axum server with a per-boot bearer
  token. Keep the logic in the pure `AgentStatusMachine` (`nebula-daemon/src/status.rs`, unit-tested with
  injected clocks) and **never trust a bare `Stop`**.
- Kitty keyboard protocol passthrough (`nebula-daemon/src/pty/kitty.rs`) is what makes Cmd/Option combos
  and Shift+Enter reach Claude Code at all.
- **Unix socket paths must stay short** — SUN_LEN is ~104 bytes, so a long `NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR` breaks
  `bind()`. This bites the test harnesses and the screenshot harness constantly.
- Ideas were borrowed from ../mission-control, but **all code is written fresh** — that was a hard user
  requirement.
